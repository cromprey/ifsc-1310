       <p>My name is Caitlin Romprey, and I am a currently finishing my freshman year of college. I am from St. George, Utah, and I moved out to Arkansas because I also got an
         athletic scholarship. I have been swimming competively for nearly 11 years and I am very grateful that I get to continue my swimming career.
       </p>
       <p>When I was deciding on what to major in, I was originally wanting to do Computer Science, but I quickly learned that wasn't for me. When I learned that Web Design and Development
         was a major, I knew it was for me. I really enjoy the coding aspect of C.S. but I didn't want to be cranking numbers all day. The thing that I love about web design, is that I get to 
         design! I have always loved art and being creative, so when I saw this major, I quickly transitioned over and have loved it since.
       </p>
       <p>A couple things about me: I love reading, hiking, and animals. I have loved reading since I was little, and I think it has been a really good way to recover and rest when I feel stressed
         out. Utah is full of great and beautiful hikes, but it has been super beautiful to go on hikes here as well. I really enjoy the differences between the two locations, Utah has natural desert beauty,
         but Arkansa has lush, green trees that make you feel super peaceful when you hike. Finally, I really enjoy animals. I especially love dogs, my roommate got a dog this semester and it has been so great
         having a little puppy around. I really enjoy taking him outside, but also teaching him new tricks.
       </p>
       <p>Finally, I wanted to say thank you to Professor Wallace because he has taught a great class this semester. I have really enjoyed being able to listen and participate in his lectures, and really look
         forward to taking his future classes!

        <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <p>Progressive Enhancement is the idea to provide content and functionality to all users. When coding, we always start with HTML. This is because it provides a foundation for our code, but it also provides the users to have the content that they need!</p>
      
        <p>Progressive Enhancement focuses on giving the experience through necessity. Most of the time, the user will click on your page because it provides the content that they are searching for, not just because it looks pretty. It is important to focus on the quality of your content because this is the most important step.</p>
      
        <p>Progressive Enhancementâ€™s next step would be to focus on giving a good design. We want to make sure that users with older browsers can get their content, but those with newer browsers can also have a good experience.</p>
  
        <p>Progressive Enhancement is a technique that allows developers to create whatever their hearts desire, while also providing the users with the content that they seek.</p>
