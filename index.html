       <p>My name is Caitlin Romprey, and I am a currently finishing my freshman year of college. I am from St. George, Utah, and I moved out to Arkansas because I also got an
         athletic scholarship. I have been swimming competively for nearly 11 years and I am very grateful that I get to continue my swimming career.
       </p>
       <p>When I was deciding on what to major in, I was originally wanting to do Computer Science, but I quickly learned that wasn't for me. When I learned that Web Design and Development
         was a major, I knew it was for me. I really enjoy the coding aspect of C.S. but I didn't want to be cranking numbers all day. The thing that I love about web design, is that I get to 
         design! I have always loved art and being creative, so when I saw this major, I quickly transitioned over and have loved it since.
       </p>
       <p>A couple things about me: I love reading, hiking, and animals. I have loved reading since I was little, and I think it has been a really good way to recover and rest when I feel stressed
         out. Utah is full of great and beautiful hikes, but it has been super beautiful to go on hikes here as well. I really enjoy the differences between the two locations, Utah has natural desert beauty,
         but Arkansa has lush, green trees that make you feel super peaceful when you hike. Finally, I really enjoy animals. I especially love dogs, my roommate got a dog this semester and it has been so great
         having a little puppy around. I really enjoy taking him outside, but also teaching him new tricks.
       </p>
       <p>Finally, I wanted to say thank you to Professor Wallace because he has taught a great class this semester. I have really enjoyed being able to listen and participate in his lectures, and really look
         forward to taking his future classes!

        <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
        <p>This has been a major learning proccess for me. I completely understand that my final project looks very similar to the example that you Proffessor Wallace showed us,
          however, I coded it myself to look like it. I did it piece by piece, and tried to add my own coding to it. I had a few struggles with it for sure, and I definetly still have
          A LOT to learn, but overall I am really proud of myself. I am not very good at coding yet, but I am happy with what I have been learning. This class has helped my learning a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, some things that I changed when I revised my rough draft to my final draft, was fix the navigation logo. I didn't know how to make it stay still inside the navigation, and it would
          move a lot when I moved my browser but I fixed that. Another thing that got brought to my attention was that when the user switched pages, it looked the same as other pages,
          so I created page names that made it more understandable. I changed the design of the website a little bit too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I still have a lot to learn, but I am generally pretty happy with the progress through this course. I am taking more courses like this over the summer to better
          my understanding, and will be doing a lot of research. 
        </p>

        <p>Again, I know it looks very similar, but it was a HUGE learning moment for me. I will continue to work on GitHUB over the summer and will be making more mock-ups of this 
          project so I can better myself.
        </p>

        <p>Some things that I would do differently would just be practicing more on my own. I always felt like I understood the process when I was following along in lectures and labs,
          however when it got time to try and do the final, I just felt a little confused. I understand the process individually, but putting it all together became a struggle. I wish I tried differentl
          web formats too. I would definetly do it differently if I got to retake this course over.

        <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <p>Progressive Enhancement is the idea to provide content and functionality to all users. When coding, we always start with HTML. This is because it provides a foundation for our code, but it also provides the users to have the content that they need!</p>
      
        <p>Progressive Enhancement focuses on giving the experience through necessity. Most of the time, the user will click on your page because it provides the content that they are searching for, not just because it looks pretty. It is important to focus on the quality of your content because this is the most important step.</p>
      
        <p>Progressive Enhancementâ€™s next step would be to focus on giving a good design. We want to make sure that users with older browsers can get their content, but those with newer browsers can also have a good experience.</p>
  
        <p>Progressive Enhancement is a technique that allows developers to create whatever their hearts desire, while also providing the users with the content that they seek.</p>
